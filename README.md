# Cub3D

Welcome to our Cub3D!<br>
This group project was created with [Yaz](https://github.com/Y4ZK4Y).

## About Cub3D 🕹️
This project is a tribute to the Wolfenstein 3D game, the first-ever FPS.<br>
It uses raycasting to generate a dynamic first-persion view inside a maze. <br>
The goal is to navigate and render a pseudo-3D environment using only 2D map data - <br>
building the illusion of depth, walls and player movement in real time.

## Key Learning Areas 🎯

 - Parsing and data validation.<br>
 - Raycasting fundamentals:<br>
   - DDA algorithm<br>
   - Distance and wall height calculations<br>
 - Player movement and controls<br>
 - Low-level rendering<br>
 - Texture and Minimap rendering<br>

## Installation :desktop_computer:
To try our Cub3D yourself, please follow the next steps:

1.  Compile our videogame with the following command:
```
$ make
```
2. Execute it with the following command. We'd recommend maps snow_maze and catacombs:
```
> $ ./cub3D mapgs/good/catacombs.cub
